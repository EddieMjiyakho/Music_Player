# 🎵 MP3 Player Project

A basic yet functional MP3 player built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, designed to help learn and practice essential web development concepts—especially JavaScript array and string methods.

## 🚀 What I Learned

This project was perfect for a juniour developer like me looking to strengthen their understanding of:

- 🔁 JavaScript array methods: `find()`, `forEach()`, `map()`, and `join()`
- 🎧 Audio playback handling in JavaScript
- 🧭 Playlist management
- ⏯️ Implementing play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle controls
- 🖼️ Dynamically updating the user interface (UI) based on the current song
